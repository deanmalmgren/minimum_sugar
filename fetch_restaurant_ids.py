Fetch Restaurant IDs
====================
Nutritionix identifies restaurants by a unique number, but from what I
can tell they do not list those numbers. This notebook contains code
which creates a mapping between the names of restaurants I frequent
and Nutritionix's restaurant ID. This mapping is written to a file
called `restaurant_ids.json`.
