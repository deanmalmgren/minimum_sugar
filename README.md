Tools to analyze the menus of restaurants for minimum sugar menu items

I recently read [Michael Grothaus's article](https://www.fastcompany.com/3050319/lessons-learned/how-giving-up-refined-sugar-changed-my-brain) on his positive experiences with giving up refined sugar.
Reading this article convinced me that abstaining from sugar was a good idea, and my doctor was enthusiastic of the idea.

As anyone who has tried to quit refined sugar knows, it is hard to find food that does not contain it -- especially at restaurants.
Scouring the internet, I've found endless articles and blog posts about how to cook food without sugar.
The issue is: I have no interest in learning how to cook or spending any time cooking.
I am perfectly happy giving my hard earned money to a pro (including the good people at Taco Bell) in exchange for delicious food -- division of labor and all that.

Instead of manually looking over menus and nutrition data for the places I patronize, I decided to build a tools that do the optimization for me.
These tools are hosted in this repo.


Restaurant menu data structure
==============================
This project contains functions to pull data from the Nutritionix database.
The data is arranged according to restaurant.
I have structured the data as a python dict with the following three fields:

* "name" : The restaurant name.
* "id"   : The Nutritionix restaurant UID.
* "menu" : A list of dicts containing the restaurant menu. Each dict contains all of the nutritional information and metadata for each menu item.
